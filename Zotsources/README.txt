How to Run This React Native Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. Install Node.js and npm
If you havenâ€™t already, download and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) which includes npm.

Verify the installation:
    node -v
    npm -v

2. Clone or Download the Project
- If using GitHub:

- If using a .zip file:
    - Extract the zip file.
    - Locate and open the extracted folder.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory
    cd ZotSources

4. Install Dependencies
Since node_modules is not included, run the following to install all required packages:
    npm install

5. Start the Development Server
    npm start

This will launch the Metro bundler (React Native's development server).

6. Run the App
- Use a connected simulator/emulator (e.g., iOS Simulator or Android Emulator).
- Or scan the QR code in the Metro bundler using the Expo Go app (if you're using Expo).

You can also open the development URL directly in a browser or simulator:
    http://localhost:8081

Use Command + click to follow the link from the terminal.
